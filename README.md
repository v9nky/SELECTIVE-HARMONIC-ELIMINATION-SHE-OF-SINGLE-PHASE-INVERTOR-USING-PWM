# SELECTIVE-HARMONIC-ELIMINATION-SHE-OF-SINGLE-PHASE-INVERTOR-USING-PWM
Implemented a SHE-PWM strategy in MATLAB/Simulink to eliminate specific lower-order harmonics in the inverter output. Achieved significant harmonic reduction while maintaining fundamental voltage performance. Analysed THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) and compared with traditional SPWM methods.
